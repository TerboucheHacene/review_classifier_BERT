1 "retailer does it again ! i 'm constantly looking for pieces that will work for a day at the office and then a night out and this skirt is perfect ! you ca n't really tell in the pictures but there is a larger slit that separates the grey material from the black which makes the skirt have more of a statement . it runs true to size and the material is thick enough that it will do great in winter !"
1 "i 'm thrilled with this purchase and looking forward to spending many years with this classic . on the subject of fit ; i generally wear size medium for tops but my broad shoulders occasionally have me in larges . since the thick-textured fabric is mostly cotton and minimal stretch ( with a mix of linen ) the larger size will provide more room and comfort . i 'm honoring my tts choice for folks who prefer a more fitted look . overall this piece wears well ! !"
1 "this is a great top except i wish it was a bit longer or i wish it came with a short tank . it hits right at my pants which would n't be terrible ( although not ideal ) except my tank that i need to wear under it is long and so i either need to tuck it in or it will hang past the shirt . neither is what i was hoping for . still like it so debating whether to take it back . i think at full price i will return and consider it again it it makes it to sale ."
-1 "i am sooooooo massively disappointed in this purchase . i thought i had found the perfect pant in this style . both more comfortable and more flattering than similar styles in the store . i wanted to wear them every day ; received lots of compliments ; felt that you could dress up or down ; etc . this is where i have to admit that i wore them several times straight from the store before washing . on the second wear i noticed threads coming out on the seams but just on one side of one leg . this was irr"

1 "this is a very pretty delicate comfortable dress . i think it fits tts - maybe even a little large . i got the ps which is my usual size and it fit perfectly . the only complaint i have is that the photo is misleading . on the dress i received there was nothing to hook the buttons into ( no loops as in the photo ) so the whole front of the dress has to be unbuttoned . i wish i was able to button 1 or 2 as in the photo ."
1 "always attracted to wool for its warmth and breathability . this jacket has great style that can be casual or dressed up some . it 's slightly more boxy then expected which i think lends to the casual look . find myself wearing it a lot ."
1 "love this dress beautiful !"
-1 "1. i like a shorter jacket but this one was poorly made and poorly fit . 2. the sleeves were way too tight . i 'm a size 10 or 12 and the large which would be a 14 had tight sleeves that wrinkled up my arms and the hem of the sleeve turned inside out . 3. i ordered both a medium ( size 10 ) and a large ( size 14 ) and neither hung right . the m too tight and the large too loose in the body and too tight in the sleeves . 4. very polyester with lots of static . 5. cute idea but not very good in pe"

1 "i have a hard time with jackets fitting because i have chubby arms compared to the rest of me . i like the way this fits and it does n't pull when i try to cross my arms in front . i feel like it 's good quality and hopefully wo n't flake the way 'vegan ' ( i.e . fake ) leather can . and i think i can throw it over a top with jeans or a dress and it will be cute and versatile . i also like the length that hits right at my hip . i 'm 5 ' 2 and do n't like when jackets like this are are too long ."

-1 "i wish i had read the other review about the color of the pink version of this sweater before i ordered it . she was absolutely right - the color is completely different in person . it is this garish pink and brown that looks like it was knit together with remaindered yarn . it 's too bad because the cut of the sweater is cute and the zipper adds a funky touch . maybe the blue is better in person ..."
-1 "i ordered these pants in my usual size ( xl ) and was shocked when i received them . the waist was huge and there was nothing in the way of an elastic or tie to keep them up . i could n't keep them on so of course back they go ! too bad ! the sweater quality is great ."
0 "this skirt is not what i was expecting at all . for starters it runs large i expected it to sit at the natural waist and it is definitely made to do so but it was a good two inches too big and therefore would n't lay flat and gaped at the front . no bueno . my biggest gripe though is that the color looks nothing like it does in the picture . they have it paired with an ivory top and the two look like they match so well but do not be fooled the background color of this skirt is not even close to"

-1 "i loved them on when i got them but they literally frayed apart on my body as i wore them and i had them on no more than 5 times . it was not a fit issue or a seam issue ; they literally just frayed apart in two areas . while flattering and incredibly comfortable the fabric was not at all durable ... they are not your typical denim they almost kind of a knit feel them ."
0 "the one i tried on had something wrong with the pockets ... one was regular height t eh other was so low i could barely put my hand in it . however the jumpsuit itself is really pretty and soft . color is nice but hard ot pull off on pale skin like me . i tried on the xs but that was big . i would need xxs p if it was made in that size so i let it go ... ( looked nice with pinched fabric in the back . for reference i am 115 lbs 30 dd < 26.5 in waist ."
0 "there is no back zip on this skirt and therefore it does not lay flat as it would if there were a zip . instead it has an elastic waist . it is very nice quality but i never would have purchased this skirt if i knew it had an elastic waist . i am 5 ' 6 and a size 6. it runs a bit large - i think this is due to the elastic waste ."
-1 "after reading the reviews i sized down to a 6. once i received it i loved the fabric and color however it was so ill-fitting . it 's like the designer did n't even use female measurements and used a box to make this top -- too wide . i liked it so much that i sized way down to a 0 and it still fit horribly . it is too wide and not long enough . both are going back !"
1 "these leggings are some of the softest i own . i ordered both the black and the moss and each has a distinct pattern . they are perfect for colder climates and fit me like a glove ."
1 "this sweater/coat is great . it super comfortable . it 's perfect for my california winters ! it could be layered for colder areas . this piece definitely runs large- like really large . i went with an xs instead of my usual small or medium . it is meant to be boxy and still is but sizing down allowed for it to be more flattering . i 'd definitely say go in store and try it on you 'll love it !"

-1 "i am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra . it 's soft and fits okay but it has zero support or shape . i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support . if i would have seen this is the store i would have passed over it . however i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it . it 's comfortable so that 's a redeeming quality . i would not recommend for larger chested ladies though !"
1 "this bathing suit is so cute . it fits me great . i 'm 5'10 and about 130 and ordered a medium . my only complaint is that the outside straps sometimes fall off my shoulders which could be annoying if you are doing anything active . but overall a great modest and cute swimsuit ."
-1 "i 'm 5 ' 5 150 lbs 32dd normally a 28p or 29p in pants . i ordered an 8 and probably should have gone with a 10. it was super unflattering ? the print was overwhelming for my pale skin it made my thin waist look larger than it really was and rode up the inside of my thighs . i have a similar bathing suit from modcloth that 's 1/3 of the price and 20x as flattering . if you have thick legs this may not be the suit for you . i returned it -- so fast ."
0 "the blouse is lovely - i loved the lace color ( though just as other reviewers mentioned its a darker blue closer to a teal color ) and edging . i am very petite for reference 5 ' 2 24 waist and 30e and normally wear a 00 or 00p . the 00 was still too wide for me around the waist/bottom and had too much of a swingy effect - it made me look like i was pregnant so i sadly returned . i wish this had more of a fitted look to it ."
-1 "mine came smelling like gasoline . not sure why but i would have kept it otherwise . it 's a smell that will be really hard to get out . looks like the picture ."
0 "cute print on both sides but far more cheek was exposed than i anticipated from the photos . the front is n't too skimpy but the back is a bit too small for my taste . definitely narrower in the back than a standard bikini cut . too bad : ( the matching top is my favorite top so i guess i 'll just have to wear black bottoms with it ."
0 "i followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down . however the jacket was still too large . it fit fine in the arms but the body/width of the jacket was huge . also i found the wool material to be extremely itchy . it might work if you are layering it over long sleeves but still make sure to size down at least one or maybe even two sizes ."

1 "beautiful color and flattering design ! cons : tends to get wrinkled and you have to be careful about ironing . i ended up buying the shirt twice because i burned a hole in it while trying to use a poor quality hotel iron . i did n't even have a chance to wear it but i loved the shirt so much that i bought it again since it was a good sale price ."
-1 "it seemed to stay in place and did not require constant readjustment . however i found the band to be extremely small and tight . it is not the most comfortable bra because of the way the band just presses into your skin ."
0 "although the design and quality were great this did not work for me . it was boxy square and overwhelmed my petite frame . if you are taller or have a longer torso this may be a great basic staple for your wardrobe ."
-1 "i am not sure who would look good in this dress . it is extremely oversized with tons of fabric that will not flatter anyone !"
0 "this spandex top in my opinion is workout wear . it is not the tank i expected to receive but my bad . it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts . it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is it should fit like this . 5 ' 5 142 lbs medium is skin tight . color is nice but as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer . quality seems fair ."
-1 "this is a beautiful kimono but just is n't made well . the one i received already had a couple small holes and a pull in the thread that was very noticeable . after reading the additional reviewer who wore it an hour and it was already pilling it is going back for good . such a shame !"
-1 "does n't feel like cotton jersey . feels like a thin version of the seamless cami . it 's not soft as i expected . it 's much thinner than expected too ."

-1 "i wish i had read the other reviews before purchasing this product . label says that you can wash and dry normally . however upon washing the outer layer shrunk and the inner lining did not . the robe will now not lay flat ; the fabric pulls at the edges and results in the inner lining being revealed when the robe is tied shut . extremely disappointed . for a $ 100 garment i expected much more . i wish i could return this ."

1 "i ordered this top on sale and so glad that i did . i am usually a small in tops but had read that it runs small . i went with a medium and wish that i picked the small . it is definitely a swing top . it 's best feature is the detailing ; it 's gorgeous . i paired it with jeans and a white denim jacket ."
0 "i really was looking forward to this piece but unfortunately it was too small to even pass through my head nevertheless i could n't even get both arms in . i got a size small and probably needed a large ; but as far as the quality and color it 's really pretty ! just go up a size or two if anything and try it out ."

0 "after the reviews about sizing i ordered the size 16 ( am normally size large ) . interestingly the tag on the blouse says it 's a 14. with all that said the blouse is cute enough and sizing up gave me enough length ( in spite of the higher sides ) that i 'm considering keeping it . although it 's a bit big it flows nicely and is n't oversized in that wide crazy way . the sleeves are a bit too big but they 're cuffed with a button and can be rolled . the fabric is somewhat crinkled in texture . i got the"

0 "this vest does n't have a button so i thought i could put my own . but when it arrived it just did n't fit that well . the opening in the front is too big the vest itself while nice and warm is not functional at all due to openings everywhere . i do n't know why even make a vest like this with no front button and such a wide opening how is one supposed to keep warm at all ?"
0 "this dress fit me like a glove and it 's very pretty on but the fabric looks and feels very cheap in person . it did n't look like a dress i spent this much money on . the lining is a very silky thick polyester that does n't seem like it would be comfortable in any sort of heat . the lace overlay has this strange fusing kind of material between the pattern that looks so cheap . i love the idea of this dress but it just is n't worth the money ( in my opinion ) so i returned it ."
0 "i really like the pattern and the cut of these pants . the fabric is nice too . however i was disappointed how much they stretched out the first ( and only ) time i wore them . i am 5 ' 6 and about 150 lbs . i ordered size 10 ; i am going to try to exchange them for a size 8 since they stretched so much ."
-1 "these pants are the perfect color and i love the detail of the zippered pockets ... i was so excited when they came in the mail and fit pretty well . they were slightly loose but i thought they would hold their shape and the size smaller would be too small . after an hour of wear i was swimming in these ! i can almost pull them down without unzipping them and the seat of the pants looks particularly um saggy . i am in-between a 4 and 6 and since the pants are detailed as slim fit i thought it"

0 "i do n't love this skirt as much as the other reviewers do . it fits a little bit weird on me and i wanted the tie to be adjustable so i could bring in the extra fabric a bit ( the knot is not adjustable ) . the skirt is borderline tight around my rear and legs so i ca n't size down . the knit is substantial so that 's something -- but i found the extra fabric around my middle just was n't flattering on me . i had recently bought and loved lilke 's tideline pencil skirt which also has a fabric tie wrap"

1 "i was returning something to the store . before i stepped out of the store when this skirt caught my eyes . it 's such a nice skirt with the gorgeous red color beautiful buttons and material that is heavy and thick but soft . i paired it with a white shirt that is currently on sale and fell in love with both matching together . it is tts i 'm 5 ' 5 and 120lb and i usually get 0-2 in size . size 0 was sold out in the store so i tried size 2 and it fits me very well . the length is great it falls 2-3 in"

-1 "so bummed . i was really hoping this top would work for me . i got the black in regular size 4 and the pink in petite size 4. both hit my breast too high and were too bulky in the mid section . i have a sort of short torso wear a small 34c and am have a defined waist . when tops are bulky it gives me no shape and just looks terrible . i am having the hardest time finding pretty tops that suit my figure . they did not lie flat like on the model but had so much extra fabric they stuck out . the constr"
0 "got this in the mail today and while the design is cute it 's not as soft and comfortable as i would like . the front clasp takes a bit of practice to get on and off . the straps are a bit thin and hurts a bit ."
0 "my first complaint is this dress is pinned back so obviously in the video that when the model turns around ( not all the way ) you can see the pin in the back . that should have been a clue that this dress is n't meant to fit anyone properly if it does n't fit the model . i agree with another reviewer that the model in the still product photos sized up and up because the dress does not fit loosely in regular size nor is it that long . you have to have a longer torso to pull off the top or the fabr"
1 "this is the second of the new dress batch i have purchased and it is lovely . this catalog shot does not do it justice . the colors are brighter but not neon lots of indigo and coral . there is a tad of yellow ? the bodice makes my aa size look much more . the bodice fits me perfectly as the top pleating is flat . the v neck is just right - not too low and the back is even prettier . the dress just fell gracefully out of the package without a wrinkle and without a mussed pleat ! that was a sh"
1 "i really liked the fit and feel of these pants except the bottom of the pant leg was more bell shaped than i wanted ( bought white pilcro culottes last year and they were n't like this ) but it was n't a deal breaker . when i got home i tried to pair the chocolate pants with something to wear in the summer but it was n't working for me . i think the color was just too dark and fall-feeling . they do run big so i 'd think about sizing down ... definitely worth giving them a try if you 're okay with the"
0 "i loved the romantic look of this robe and gown set but the material was very thin and wrinkled and needs to be ironed . the m/l was uncomfortable and i normally wear only a m. sadly i returned the set ."
0 "i was looking for an undergarment and this is more of a nightgown . if it came in a solid color then i 'd probably buy it . i usually wear a small and this was a tad too tight . on the upside the fabric was soft and lightweight ."
1 "tried these on several times in store and never bought them but was able to get them with a 20 % email- seemed like a better price for the product . the color is rust and a little odd for my wardrobe - wish they also came in black . love the style and they are very comfortable perfect for late summer- can wear on errands or dress them up a little with shoes/accessories for casual dinner out . happy i finally purchased them !"
1 "i love this piece and have bought it for three different clients as well as myself ... it runs a size larger - i am usually a 4 and the 2 fits perfectly . the skort was one size off for my clients too . definitely a great choice for spring/summer especially if you love to dress up but lead an active lifestyle !"

1 "a nice alternative to jeans good fit . i like the casual but edgy rocker look they have . will look good with booties and full length boots . i took the same size that i do in all pilcro pants ."
1 "this arrived in my store this morning and it is as cute as it appears online ! ! i 'm a curvy gal so i honestly was n't feeling like this would look good on me . but it is thick and the fabric is sturdy so it lays on me exactly the way it does on the model ! the fabric on the blue side almost has a vinyl feel to it ... like it would be rainproof ! the sherpa layer is super soft and in my opinion even cuter than the blue side ! the trim is all lined with a faux leather and the ties on each side can be adj"
1 "i loved this skirt on but just the other reviewers it runs small in the waist throwing off the dimension of the skirt . i ended up getting the 0 despite the fact that it was tighter in the waist because the 2 at this length ( with my height ) and amount of material became overwhelming on me . it would have looked better in a slightly shorter cut as another reviewer stated as well ."
0 "these are very cute leggings . i love the ribbed bottoms . as far as design and comfort they are a five . but after only two wearings they are pilling like crazy and look shabby . i 'm very happy i only paid $ 23 for them . if i paid full price i 'd be more upset ."
1 "these shorts are extremely cute ! i usually have a hard time finding shorts i like but when i saw these the floral and brocade was too nice not to try . the length is good and they are not tight on the thighs but not too loose either . the material makes them friendly for work as well as outings and running about town . i got my usual size 8 and found that to work perfectly !"

0 "i order from retailer regularly and am pretty consistently a 0 petite or xxs petite . i ordered this in a 0 petite and it was like 5 inches too small in the rib cage and chest area . even if i would have got it zipped up the halter cut is cut narrow so you ca n't wear a bra for sure ... strapless would be necessary . also the actual neck part was tight . for reference i am 5 ' 3 108 pounds and a 32c bust . it seems you need to be flat chested to pull this one off and maybe missing a few ribs ."
1 "i 'm tall with long legs long arms and a small chest and the medium fits me almost perfectly . i love the long sleeves ( sleeve length is always a challenge for me ) and how the coat accommodates my broad shoulders . my only problem is that the belt wraps around my lower ribs and looks odd . if i can get the belt loops lowered 1.5-2 inches it will be perfect . if i ca n't i 'll return it because the coat looks much better with the belt tied if it 's buttoned up . one small point : the coat arrived incr"
-1 "this is a great dress if you do n't want to leave the house or you want the world to see your nipples ."
-1 "this runs sooo big ! i normally wear a large ( 145lb 5'-4 36dd ) but due to the limited sizing small or medium i chose small because it looked big on the model and this style of dress seem to run large . the size small that i ordered couldve fit two people easily together ! i loved the pattern color and the slip underneath actually fit well but i dont want to look like im wearing a tent lol . also the back is slightly longer than the front something i couldnt see from the pictures online ."

0 "i loved this when i got it . it has such a flattering fit ! slightly loose in the body but not flowy . nice weight of fabric . comfortable fabric . perfect scoop neck that does n't show too much cleavage . but i washed it once on delicate and line dried ( which i do with most of my shirts ) and it came out riddled in holes ."
0 "the fabric was more southwestern looking when i got it than it looked in the pics . it fit a bit larger around the bottom than i like ."
1 "i am normally a 4 but they only had the white in size 2 so i tried it . i was pleased to see that it worked out just fine because it is meant to flow therefore has plenty of fabric . it is very graceful and very pleasant to wear . i do n't know how to explain it but i had to take a second look when i saw it on the photograph because i was not sure it was the same blouse . much better in reality than on the picture ."
0 "this top is beautiful to look at but did not fit me like the model . it was tight across the bust but very poofy at the bottom which normally i like but not this time . sad ."
1 "i love these jeans . i bought my normal size 28 but after just two hours of wearing them they had stretched out so much that i could take them off without un-buttoning them ! ( i probably could have gone two sizes smaller but i wanted them to fit loose ) . my local store was willing to offer me an exchange . kudos to retailer 's wonderful customer service and standing by their products ! i actually wear mine un-cuffed with boots and it looks super cute ."
0 "i wanted to love these but they 're so tight around the top . my legs are normal size and i could n't get them above my knee . the top is n't stretchy ... it has a string that keeps it from expanding . they are so very cute but unfortunately must go back for me ."
1 "i am pleasantly surprised by this purchase . i went back and forth on buy-in this but ended up trying it out . so glad i did ! it is very flattering and a very nice color . it fits perfectly and i look forward to wearing it with my distressed denim and boots for fall ."

0 "i loved the lavender color on the cape . it was soft and comfortable . but the design on the front ruined it for me . it took me all of 1 minute to know it was going back . it looked like florescent bird feathers nothing wrong with that it just was n't my style at all . i was a bit disappointed as it would have been perfect for cool ca nights . it looked more subdued in the photo it 's not . i clicked i would recommend to others as it is nicely made and i guess just not my taste as far as the colors an"
1 "this is one of the most comfortable swimsuits i own . i purchased it in the turquoise dots print and found that it was colorful and perfect for a beach getaway . the adjustable halter style makes it really comfortable yet cute . i highly recommend this suit to those looking for a unique yet whimsical swimsuit style ."
1 "love this skirt . purchased it in a 0 and it fit fairly good . sat high up on the waist which i like . however now that i have worn it i should have ordered it in a 2. i think the 2 would have let it sit further down making it not so short . i do recommend this skirt but i would order both your regular size and one size up ( 0 is my typical size in full skirts ) ."
-1 "love the tegan tunic version of this dress . i assumed since it looked identical except for the length that the sizing was the same but i was wrong . this runs so big ! i got a s in the tegan but the s in this dress looked like an oversized potato sack on . i highly recommend ordering at least 2 sizes down unless you want to look tent-y ."
0 "i love this suit ! the pattern is just lovely . unfortunately i have to return the suit because i ca n't wear it . there are no cups or pads or underwire for the chest . you have to look like the model wearing the suit to wear this . if you need any support than give up . who can wear an xl and not have some breasts at all ? the neckline is also very low and ended up revealing the top half of my breasts . the birds of paradise are just lovely not exactly the same on every suit but still nice . i just"
1 "did not even know this is available in petite ! as someone who is at 5 ' exaggerated there regular size xs/s fits nicely . great find . goes well with leggings or jeans . this will be a wardrobe staple for quite a while ."
-1 "i am so sad i have to return these leggings . they 're adorable -- so much so that my fiancã© commented favorably on them -- but as other reviewers have pointed out there 's no elastic or string in the waistband so you have to walk around holding them up with one hand or they 'll fall down ! why sleeping on snow ? whyyyyyyyyyyy ? they 're so great otherwise !"
-1 "my 3 daughters and i all wear a size small and are heights range between 5 ' 2 and 5'10 . this dress was sloppy on every one of us . i do n't think a size x small would have made a difference . the length is all over the place .im not sure how or where you would fit a bra into the picture . on the positive side was very soft . it may work as a beach cover -up ."
0 "i purchased the stripped blouse and it was very large around the armhole . it bulged open as if it needed a dart . i even washed it to see if it would shrink to fit and it was better but not good enough . i hate my bra showing through the armhole . it 's going back . cute blouse except for that . i love sleeveless blouses with turtlenecks ."
1 "i have n't worn these yet but i would n't wear them just to lounge in . i wear an xs & they fit good & tts . they have an elastic waist but it drapes nice & does n't bunch like some do . the material is soft & hangs nice . & does n't seems like it will wrinkle . love the pattern of the black print ones . it 's black tan & white & kind of a paisley print . i think it looks better on than in the picture ."
-1 "it 's like a work of art but sadly not flattering on me . i absolutely loved the look and even considered taking it to a tailor but the material overall is very stiff . if you 're teeny tiny and need something to give you the illusion of hips you might love it . very sad to return this ."
-1 "way too long ... the sizing is incredibly off on this product . order a size or two down ."
-1 "material is so thin this shirt ripped in three places after wearing only once . got a size larger than i needed as i have a larger chest and even though it 's a bit lose the thread has ripped material on my chest and in the armpits ."
-1 "i ordered a size large however as a large my chest is large as well . this nighty barley covered me ( in the chest region ) . the rest of the body fit well ."
-1 "very small ! so disappointed ! they did not even have a size for me to exchange a day later when they arrived !"
1 "i absolutely adore this top ! it is super soft . i purchased it in the wine color . i would recommend this for anyone ! if they have other colors i plan on buying them . i am going to wear this with jeans and my furry vest in the fall/winter ."
0 "this shirt flows beautifully and the fabric is almost wrinkle free . i also love that it 's the perfect weight and not too low cut and that the buttons are covered . however the stitching started to come undone the first time a wore it ! i did n't even wash the shirt yet . sadly i do n't think i can recommend this shirt though maybe give it a try- i might have got a defective one . oh this shirt also seems to run a bit large through the body but it still looks great . i hope this helps !"
0 "this is a beautiful lined jacket with a much more structured fit than a typical kimono . it hit me at the high hip not low hip as shown on the model . given how structured it is i do n't think the one size will work for anyone larger than a small if you want a drapey kimono fit ."
1 "i ordered the black ( not yet available ) through my store as the xs was too big and we tried ordering xs petite but it was not yet available . so we ordered xxs . ( i am 115lbs ) . it fits nicely but - as mentioned in previous review - it is thin . not see through in black but thin . cut is nice though i still think petite would fit me better i n length but xxs was good ... got a think if i will keep or not as htis is a nice summer basic ..."
-1 "this looks great on the model but when it arrived i could n't believe it was the same jacket . it looks a bit like a really loose garbage bag on me and no amount of adjusting drawstrings is going to fix it . i really wanted to like it but even the xs/s was too baggy . also a bit worried based on other reviews that it is n't actually a rain jacket and wont keep you dry ."
1 "i liked this coat but my family said it looked too much like something hilary clinton would wear . i am 54 and i think it made me look a bit dowdy since it runs a bit big ."
-1 "although i love the soft feel of the sweater the zig zag design was very unflattering . also the length is much shorter than appears in the picture . i will be returning it ."
0 "i 'm keeping these shorts because they are cute . i sized down as the previous reviews suggested and they fit great but they are snug around the legs . i think i would have preferred a more baggy look but then they would have been too big around the waist ( had i ordered my typical size ) . they are soft and comfortable the navy color is really pretty ."
1 "love this tank ! so easy to throw on quickly and still look out together !"
0 "got this on sale in black and red and have only worn the black . quality is poor seems to stretch out over the course of the day and loses its shape somewhat . a smaller size may keep its shape better so you may want to size down . not worth full price ."
0 "i tried this on in the store and the colors and fabric are terrific . it 's very light-weight fabric but is n't see-through . the colors are medium in depth not too bright . if you typically wear cool colors and avoid browns you may be able to wear this because the brown is very muted . there 's two strings inside that you tie around your waist to pull the bust of the dress in . i 'm 5 ' 4 and 125 lbs so there 's simply too much fabric in the dress . i would have bought a petite . the tag says it 's avai"
-1 "the material is very nice . not flimsy at all which is nice . the problem was the fit around the arms . i am a petite person with a small chest but it still did n't cover me bra . i 'll be returning it ."
1 "this bra is extremely comfortable and surprisingly supportive considering the lack of padding or firm material . it also runs large ."
1 "great little summer jacket that takes the place of a jean jacket . i am not usually fond of olive green but this is a bit deeper than a drab olive without being too green . it is sooo soft and comfortable that i find i am pairing it with all sorts of outfits . fits tts if you are going for the look on the model- not too fitted . i highly recommend this timeless piece ."
-1 "these are my all time comfiest shorts and i am obsessed with the lavender color . sadly using free and clear detergent on a cold delicate cycle made the color turn splotchy and they are unwearable . this happened once and i exchanged for another pair but i 'll be returning this pair . i 'll be sad to see my favorite color go but there is obviously a defect in the dye used . maybe i 'll try another color !"
0 "i wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors but after only a few minutes of wearing them i was having to pull them out of my bottom ! why does women 's underwear so frequently ride up ? i normally wear a size 4/28 and ordered these in a m but i guess they were still too small which seems unreasonable to me . they are soft and pretty but i will not be ordering more ."
1 "this midi skirt has a really nice drape with great seasonal colors ! ca n't wait to pair it with my wine color booties !"
1 "this piece fits true to size and is very flattering on . sometimes i worry about my stomach not being perfectly flat but this was n't an issue at all probably because of the intricate lace details . the fabric is substantial enough that i do n't feel like it 'll get a hole in it after multiple wears ."
1 "this dress is gorgeous ! i ordered it because i was getting other things and there was free shipping . i am 5 ' 3.5 and abt 123 lbs . usually between an xs and s and also between reg & petite . sometimes i have to order multiple sizes to get a decent fit . i ordered a sz small petite and it 's perfect . super soft great colors perfect length ! ! love it !"
-1 "i would really like this dress if the material were a little thicker . it 's really thin so you can see my nipples straight through the dress . you ca n't wear a bra with it because it is backless so i do n't understand how you are supposed to wear this outside of the house ."
0 "i like this shirt as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts . however after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans . so : good if you do n't like long t-shirts bad if you are tall like me ( 5 ' 8 ) and do n't want to wear a crop top ."
-1 "this product looks great on the model but for anyone with a normal body type the band in the center is way too tight . i 'm a 34a and wear a 27 pants and it was huge in the bust and too small in the waist and hips . the violet one looks much more blue in the photograph it is truly lavender and purple . i really wanted to love this swimsuit but instead i had to return it pay for return shipping and i am out about $ 20 now . very disappointed ."
-1 "this is a beautiful dress but the fit was strange . i have a small waist and larger hips . i generally wear a 0-2 in a fit & flare style but styles like this i generally wear a 2-4 for my hips . even in a 4 this was catching on my hips and looked kind of dumpy on my top half . i really think this dress would be great on a frame that had wider shoulders and smaller hips . it really is pretty ."
0 "i recommend with reservations . these leggings are 100 % wool soft not itchy light weight lovely knitted pattern . they run large . i sized down to a small . the first time i wore them they were fine . but the second time the waist stretched out and was useless : they were falling down as i walked . such a shame because everything else about them is perfect for cold winter days . they even fit under my silk skirt and would make other lighter garments wearable in winter . so what to do ? at the price th"
0 "initially i bought this because i liked the color and style of this trench coat . i thought it could look very chic and polished . the problem was it was too large and too wrinkly . i 'm 5 ' 2 ( 115 lbs ) and ordered an xs because petite sizes were unavailable . but i realize that a petite xs would 've been a better fit . also the sleeves were too long even with an xs . i 've already returned the product ."
0 "so this dress is extremely comfortable but it 's just really awkward . i am on the fence about keeping it my husband loves it and thinks i should . it just draws attention to the belly so any issues after having kids is very noticeable . not to mention the huge cutouts for the arms . very comfortable but not sure if i will keep it ."

0 "i received these as a christmas gift . they are really cozy : warm soft and super comfortable . however they stretch out a lot as there is no drawstring or elastic on the waist band . this leads them to poof out a lot and i have to keep pulling them up . this is fine for hanging out around the house but not if you want to wear them out and about . i 'm keeping them because they 're so comfortable but beware how much they stretch . ( i am 5 ' 6 130 lbs and the size small fits well ) ."
1 "i had to order this blouse since it is named after the town i live in . it does not disappoint . the flowers are so pretty and it has great style . there is a little piece in the neckline so it is not too revealing . the sleeves are loose and cover the bra strap underneath . the back has a little bit of elastic so it does not look like a maternity shirt and it gives you some shape . i ca n't wait for it to warm up and to wear this !"
-1 "i was so disappointed with the quality of this dress especially because it looks so beautiful on the model . the fabric was so thin that after one hand wash it 's already developing a tiny hole and pilling . also it is definitely not a day dress -- i wore it as a swim coverup but it is much too thin and pajama-like to be worn as an actual dress . the color is much different in person -- the blue is brighter and for lack of a better way to describe it cheap looking . the white banding around the t"

-1 "thought i would splurge on a tracy reese coat . i got a size small ( 120 5 ' 6 ) felt huge on me and i looked like a wooly mammoth . very unflattering . another reviewer also mentioned on how it flairs slightly at the bottom ? .adding to the overall bad look . i had it on for about 20 seconds and put it back in the bag to return . di n't have to ponder about it at all ."

-1 "the cut of this piece is great the quality of the fabric is terrible . i used it under another layer the first day i wore it and it pilled across the bust . after hand washing in cold water and hanging to dry it shrank in length- so much that i can no longer even wear it . i always happily pay a premium for quality staple wardrobe pieces . this did n't hold up to one wearing let alone one season . i recommend strongly against it ."

-1 "i purchased these pants while on vacation because i thought they 'd be the perfect addition to my comfy travel wardrobe . on my second wear i happened to be on a long-haul flight when the entire side seam split about a food long on my upper outer thigh . luckily i 'd packed a back-up dress . the pants were n't tight at all but the seams wre n't strong enough to handle a little pressure from sitting i guess . poor construction . i would not recommend these ."

1 "this is a cute fun addition to my wardrobe especially since i am a polka dot fan ! it is alittle short for me and i think it runs just a bit small particularly if you want to wear like the model with longer shirt under it . overall it was worth the sale price and will look good with casual pants jeans and with dressier black pants for work ."

0 "very pretty but runs tight - i usually wear an 8 or small/med in retailer jackets and could n't zip up the 8 ( am a 36c and thick/broad at the top ) as there is no give . this is also more like a fitted shirt made of lightweight muslin-like fabric . was looking for a summer jacket to wear over knits in a chilly air conditioned office setting so sadly it did n't work for me . could be cute on someone with a smaller frame over a tank or cami ."
1 "$ 78 for a pair of sweats seems like a lot of money but not when you consider the amount of wear you will get out of these pants . they are thin and a little on the long side but very flattering . plus the thin material makes them perfect for summer nights . i love the pockets . not a big fan of the tie on the front but that 's just a personal preference . i wo n't just be wearing these on the weekend . i found lots of fun tops and jackets in my closet that will turn these pants into something i 'll b"

-1 "i 've been buying stevie ankles for years from retailer and been very happy . the past two pairs i bought had a heavy chemical smell which i imagine is some kind of starch/chemical to keep the denim stiff . with the first pair after enough washes to get rid of the bad smell ( 4 ) they lost all form and looked terrible since they were washed i could n't return them . the 2nd pair arrived with the same heavy smell and i returned them . it may be they are made elsewhere now but it 's disappointing ."
0 "i received this top and loved the pattern . however i ordered both and s and m and the bust sizing on this top is very odd . i am a 34c and the bust area was way too big on both but if i had sized down to the xs the rest of the suit would be too small . maybe it 's just made for busty people ? also the supportive material in the bust area goes straight across kind of like a bandeau so that added to the odd look of the bust . it 's still a beautiful pattern so if you 're going to give it a try orde"

0 "for reference i am 5 ' 5 and 145lbs with an hourglass figure and bought a 8 petite instead of my usual 6 because i wanted it to be a bit shorter with the a-line design . the skirt fit perfectly but the waistband is not stretchy like the rest of the skirt . the quality is great but the design and color is not . the skirt is actually much darker of a red than in the picture more like a dark red wine . it is super a-line which was not flattering on me and the layers are all individual pieces of fabric"
1 "loved this sweater when i saw it online . when it arrived it had a very strong chemical smell to it and was very stiff textured . despite the dry clean only tag i decided to soak it overnight in woolite to soften it and get rid of the smell . the next day i rinsed it in cold water and block dried it outside . it still wreaked of chemicals and took three more subsequent washings to finally get rid of the smell . hand washing did not hurt it whatsoever fyi . it looks fab with jeans and is very comfy . i"

1 "the tunic is very pretty ! when i visited antho store i was just fallen in love with it . i purchased purple one because the color is for fall . this is good for straight and slender body type . please purchase it before it is gone !"

0 "these jeans look slouchy and shorter in the pic which was exactly what i was looking for but they fit more like regular boot cuts on me and proved to be much longer than expected . i have fairly long legs and most jeans hit me like they do on the models but these were very long . i only buy citizens of humanity and paige jeans and i can almost always buy online for them when it comes to skinny jeans but these did not fit the same as their other styles . they are good quality and would probably f"
1 "this dress is even better in person than in the photos online . the colors are vibrant the material has a nice warm weight to it and the buttons give the whole dress that something extra to make it special . i only wish the dress came with a couple of extra buttons as the first time i wore it one of the buttons came loose and i had to sew it back on to make sure it did n't fall off . the dress does run a little small i think - i normally am an extra small but the small fit me very well ."
-1 "online this looks like a great sweater . i ordered an xxsp and found that this sweater is much wider in the middle than pictured . in fact i 'm pretty sure they pinned the shirt in the back for the picture to make it appear slimmer . unfortunately this sweater will not work for me as i am an hourglass shape and this shirt makes me look 20 pounds heavier ."
1 "love this flowing cute top ! casual but can be easily dressed up . great fit ."
1 "saw this at the store and it is breathtaking in person . as the previous reviewer stated i too consider this a dress and not a tunic and it 's not really crinkled either . the dress is structured very soft and so gorgeous on . i tried on a regular x-small and it fit but a bit uncomfortable at the mid section . the small fit better ( it 's meant to be a bit loose bohemian looking ) and the hem falls right at my knees which is perfect for the office ( i 'm 5 ' 2 34b 26 waist 36 hips ) . i have medium o"
0 "i adored this suit - the style the colors the thick quality of the fabric ... but unfortunately the bottom seams cut into my groin and backside so much it was practically painful ! i 'm 5 ' 7 ' 128 lbs and usually wear a size small but was advised to size up . even with the medium i tried on everything fit well but the length though i 've never thought i had a long torso . sizing up to a large would make the bust way to large for my small b chest . was so sad to return this suit !"
0 "these are a great casual pants with a lot of style . my major disappointment comes from the inconsistent sizing within the size runs . i purchased a 29 in store which fit i then ordered another 29 online which did not fit there is at least an inch difference please see photos . i then ordered a 30 online to see if that would be better and there 's over 2 inches of difference within the same size run of the 30s . who is making these pants ? ca n't they get the pants to be the same size within the sa"

-1 "i ordered this in a small petite and medium petite and i am a huge fan of a * k. i put tried on the sp . while it fit it was very long even for a petite . what i hated about it was that the piping on the top made me look very wide . even a long necklace would n't help deter the look . on a positive side the blue was a very nice cool color . i am usually a small to medium in a * k ( 6-8 in tops ) and the small fit well in the arms/bodice just too much fabric for me . returning !"
1 "my stylist did n't love them ... they are well made the waist line is comfortable and the embroidery is very pretty . the hem is loose-fitting perhaps that is what she thought was not as flattering ... the material is airy nice for summer i think you should give these a try for me perhaps it is my muscular legs that made her hesitate ."
1 "i 'm about 130 lbs . and 6 ' tall and usually a small would be my size . these fit but i would be more comfy in a m. they are stretchy soft and opaque . perfect for under a couple sweater dresses i picked up by retailer ! ! ! will be re-ordering ."

1 "really stretchy and therefore not a whole lot of compression . love the floral pattern and the color but they 're also surprisingly thin . they 'll be good for yoga in the summer months but i find them to be too thin to wear outside of the gym and i like a legging i can feel comfortable in running errands to and from the gym too . fit true to size ."
-1 "like others i finally received my size 6p black pants after months of waiting . for starters these pants run small so i ordered a size up but still in petite because i adored the red ones i got this past summer . when the black pants arrived they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones ( which were also 6p ) and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality . i 'm debating ordering the regular length but i 'm not sure i 'll bother based on some of the other reviews ."
0 "this jumpsuit is lovely and comfortable with gorgeous embroidered detailing but it really needs to come in petite sizes . at 5 ' 4 with a pretty proportional torso to leg ratio i found the hem length okay but the top portion way too long . for the waistband to be anywhere near my natural waist the shoulders would have had to be taken up several inches and the armholes shortened ."

-1 "this skirt is very short . i ordered my usual xs petite and it was so short that the longest part ended above my ankle . that 's quite off because i 'm only 5 feet tall and i wore it pretty low on the hips . it also flares out awkwardly below the knee . there are 2 vertical seems and they exacerbate the jagged appearance of the hem . i was drawn to the edgy style shown in the photo but in person it looks like my 5 year old cut up a skirt . plus the fabric -- while thick and beautiful and stretchy -- has a"
-1 "i wanted to like this and even considered getting it altered but just decided to return . it runs big and from the front it looks good but the back just looked like a big oversized stretched out tank . it was so comfy on though and not sheer or revealing . so if you 're tall go for it ! !"
0 "this trench is beautiful with a lovely swinging skirt that adds a romantic sense of drama and movement - you 'll feel as though you are starring in your very own film noir movie . i wish i could have kept it but i could n't justify paying full price on a coat that had to be hand-washed ( the label specifies no dry cleaning ! ) .there is a lot of fabric on this trench and i imagine that all those little pleats will have to be ironed too . i do n't have the time for that and for this much money i wou"

0 "not for the curvy women . fit in the waist but bunched around the crotch"
-1 "woah these jeans looked ridiculous on me . i felt as though it was 1987 and i was raiding my mom 's closet . the combination of the light wash the crop leg and high waist with the odd stitching around the midsection make this a no . it really accentuates any pouch you may have . i was looking for a high waisted denim but these are very unflattering . i am 5 ' 3 / 140 curvy . no no no !"
-1 "this was n't for me . i have a short neck and am 5.3. the length was fine on the one i tried on but other proportions were off . it was too big around in the middle yet tighter at the bottom . on me this made it resemble a large bag . the neckline stood up on mine . even when i pushed it down to resemble the picture here with the model it still felt like a whiplash collar ( coming up over my chin ) . i gave it four stars for quality since the material is so soft ."
-1 "i tried this on in my regular size and was able to get it on fine but the cup portion of the suit was just crazy ! with the straps tied tightly around my neck it was like the cups just flipped out and open . i am a regular b cup and i don ; t think it was sizing ( though i did not have the opportunity to try multiple sizes ) . the cup did not right and for this reason would make this absolutely impossible to wear . unfortunate because the design is so pretty ."
1 "these pants are simply darling ! i purchased them with my birthday discount ( thank you retailer ! ) and even without a discount i think they are worth every penny . flattering and the most important feature of any pant makes my butt look good . do n't hesitate buy these today before they are out of stock . the fit is true to size and the material is of excellent quality ."
-1 "big pockets make it look more like a bathrobe than a coat . there are no internal pockets and the loops for the belt are pretty skimpy - just a bit of string . the color is great but the quality leaves something to be desired ."
-1 "so wanted great pair of sweater leggings ... great for running errands and keeping the outfit simple . these are not that . these fit very poorly ... i ordered the small which is more like a large one in the waistline ... there is nothing to hold these up and i could fit two of me in them . unfortunately i thought all would be fine and i discarded the receipt and have worn them a few times~"

-1 "the fit on this is so strange . the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift . the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price . the cups are padded which is nice i suppose but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup i 'm guessing . i 'm a 32dd size 8 in pants and size 4/6 in dresses and i ordered a medium . i also have a long torso which probably did n't help ."

-1 "finally received this in the mail today and was very disappointed . i am swimming in the xs ( 5 ' 4 110lbs ) . the colors are much more vibrant that shown in the pics - the green is a bright kelly green the red is much more red than rust colored etc . and it 's a sweater coat ! for the price i was expecting it to be lined and higher quality . i do n't doubt that it will be warm but ca n't justify the price . it 's going back to the store ."
0 "i bought the s ; came with a tag saying sz 8. it is in fact more like a size 2 if not 0. the bust is probably a 34 a or b or 32a or b - the cups fit me relatively well but the rest was so tight that i could barely manage to put put it in . i ca n't imagine wrestling with this bathing suit each time i want to wear it so i will return it . the fabric design is as spectacular as it looks though ... very good quality ."
0 "maybe it 's just that it 's a bath robe but i 'm not crazy about how this falls . it is very soft cozy and cute though ."
-1 "i would say the skirt runs two sizes too small . i usually wear a size medium and based on other reviews i purchased a large . i could barely get the skirt over my hips . even if it fit in the waist it was much too short on me and i 'm 5 ' 2 . it 's a cute skirt but it is fit for a tween ."
1 "i wore this tunic everyday on vacation in hawaii . runs a little small i 'm usually a small and the x-small was just right . perfect length short but not too short ."
0 "i have more of an athletic figure and the sleeves tend to come in closer to the body than pictured . i did n't like that cut on my arms/torso . the shirt is really cute otherwise ! i am usually a size 4/small and this was a little short and snug ."
-1 "i wanted to love this but instead of being a flowy kimono top as pictured- it was a thick blazer type garment . not at all what is pictured here unfortunately . also it was much shorter than pictured and i am only 5 ' 4 '' . love most retailer styles but this one was a miss and a return ."
0 "i believe that this sweater is by moth and not knitted and knotted as noted in the description . for me this tunic was just ok. i did n't think that the quality was great and it just did n't wow me especially at this price point ."
1 "this robe is so pretty i kind of feel like a movie star when i wear it ! the embroidered flowers and trim are a very nice touch . the fabric is very light and soft i 'm sure it will feel nice and cool on those hot summer nights ahead . the fit is true to size and is actually a bit longer than what is shown on the model . i am extremely happy i decided to make this purchase ."
-1 "i wanted to love this jumpsuit . it looks adorable in the product photo . i am 5 ' 5 about 120lbs and thus was overwhelming on me . i tried everything -- - pulling up the tie at the waist to create a higher line wearing a variety of heel heights -- -- i could n't seem to make it work . there was just so much fabric on me ! it felt like i was wearing pajamas ( and not in a cute 'wear your pajamas out ' way ) . i love the idea and the photo appears to have an adorable line and cut . on me this jumpsuit was just"
-1 "the print does n't necessarily works for everybody ."
-1 "this looked fabulous on the model of course and i love sweater dresses . but even in an xs i was drowning in fabric and looked ludicrous . concept is good but execution went terribly wrong somewhere . a definite return ."
-1 "this skirt is definitely not what i was expecting . the material is stiff and rough . the skirt is also loud . you can hear it swishing when you move and not in a classy way . it feels like you 're wearing a very long tutu . also the pattern is n't quite as pretty in person . they must have used magic in order to make this skirt look flowy in the photos - it does not flow ."
0 "if the sweater looked as it does in the picture i would keep it . however it was very boxy and short a style that does not work for me at all . i 'm 5 ft. 6 in . and ordered the medium . i suspect the sweater on the model may be clipped back to make it look more form fitting . unfortunately i will have to return the sweater ."
0 "i just loved this when i saw it in store . beautiful fabric lovely color . i ordered a small petite because petite xs was sold out . i imagine it might be a little better if it were a size smaller but there is sooo much fabric in the pleated bottom unless you are blessed with exceptionally long legs it might end up looking like a witches coat . at least that is what i was told by my daughter ."
1 "had been eyeing this for a while . print is beautiful in person just as pictured . tts fit ( size 8 5 ' 7 150 # pear shaped ) . comes within a couple inches of my knees so long enough to wear to work ."
0 "i found these to fit odd . i am also use to wearing the skinny jeans so trying a wide leg was a bit weird anyway . the placement of the pockets and the way it hit my waist was awkward and not flattering . i am usually a 8/10 and the 8 fit but just did not look good ."
-1 "the skirt is just okay . the design is great but the material is extremely thin and see through . there is a slip which goes to mid-thigh- very strange and felt weird as well . the pleats are okay but not great . overall it is not worth paying full price for or anywhere near that . and again be wary of it being see through ."
1 "so i really like the plaid designs by siyu . i saw these pants and questioned whether they would be tight and scratchy and ill fitting but they were so cute i had to find out . i 'm really glad i did . the wool is soft and actually a little stretchy . it has an elastic waist which is a plus because sometimes even if the legs fit the waist is too small or vice versa . i am a large and very curvy on the bottom and these are perfect and flattering and the elastic waist is just right . as on the"
-1 "does not say ribbed . did not want ribbed . would not have bought ribbed"
0 "i wanted to love this set but sadly it just did n't fit as i had hoped . the small was bigger than expected and looked frumpy and not sexy . returned ."
0 "would recommend but with the caveat that i had to return due to the pants being way too big all over even the length was more than i expected from the photos online . i am 5 ' 5 120lbs narrow hips usually a 25 in pants ( including other level 99 pants i own ) . i ordered a 25 and i could have pulled them off completely buttoned plus they went nearly to my ankles . anyhow the material is really nice soft and comfy color was good ( i ordered the dark ) and i could imagine they would be super cute"
1 "so hard to guess fit and size so because i carry my weight in my tummy i ordered an xl . they were too big . the waistband is a nice very wide comfy elastic but fit loose . the legs were a bit baggy too and too long for my frame . the fabric is soft and has a bit of a contrast down the sides of the leg . due to the length i decided not to reorder a smaller size . i think you 'd be safe to size down in these ."
0 "i remember seeing this great jackets online and knowing that i would have to have it ! so i traveled to the store to try it on . the ruffle on the bottom was beautiful and fluffy and just like the pictures . the color was perfect and it was lightweight enough i could get more uses out of it that most of my coats in the texas heat . so i tried on the small . the did n't quite button over my bust and i did an arm wiggle that made the arms too tight near where they met my body . no problem medium it is ."
1 "uncomfortable in the leg area but otherwise very flattering ."
0 "i ordered this in black and white thinking you can never have enough silk camisoles . i returned the black because it looked like polyester . the white is actually a cream/ivory not bright white as pictured . it is also not the best feeling quality however the fit is good and true to size ."
