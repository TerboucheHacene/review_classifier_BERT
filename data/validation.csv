-1 "i noticed this top on one of the sales associates and it looked great . she 's probably 230lbs and about 5 ' 5 . tried it on and it looked horrible i even tried sizing down twice . i 'm 5 ' 8 and the ruffles started right under my chest . i gave 2 stars bc of the material it is light and summery ."
-1 "the model looks like she 's 14 years old - this sweater of course would fit a younger teen . it definitely wo n't work for a grown woman . please make some longer sweaters ."
1 "they fit me great are super comfortable . they are casual yet also stylish thanks to details like the colorful waistband and the zippers on the side of the legs . they looks great and i think i can wear them for many occasions . i love them with booties : ) . i think they look better in person than online too"
0 "i was so excited to try this on after having discovered it on the retailer app and stepping into the store and seeing it . on the hanger it looked alright but once i slipped it on it 's like everything i 've got going for me disappeared . granted i 'm s little bottom heavy so these types of dresses do n't typically flatter my body type anyways ."
1 "i love this as a lounge-at-home top . the colors and pattern are really pretty it 's soft and warm . very comfy and cozy . but it 's also boxy and thick so not a flattering cut ."
-1 "this coat is awful just awful . i bought it based on the reviews my husband said it looks like i am wearing a mattress . it looked awful . i really really liked the softness and that it was n't like another puffer coat it was also stretchy and the buttons super easy to wear but the look style and design make it very unflattering . it looked so bad that i took it off right away . so disappointing !"
0 "i 'm 5 ' 9 and these run true to size for the fit but having long legs by the end of the day they start to sag down in the crotch and hit me about mid calf straight out is the package . they wash up perfectly and are cozy . if you 're of average height these will probably be your favorite ."
-1 "this sweater coat is very bulky and has an odd and unflattering shape when on ."
-1 "the cups on this suit are ridiculous . unless you are going to a nudist beach i do not recommend . the construction of the suit itself was also vey poor . seams were messed up a big pull right on the front -- i brought it back . sad because the design was adorable- just poor execution ."
1 "great jacket . love that the hoodie insert is removable so i can wear just the outer jacket for work ."
-1 "i was really disappointed with these pants . they were a thinner fabric than expected with little to no stretch . they were very tight around my legs and huge at the waist . sadly they will be going back ."
1 "these leggings are awesome quality especially for the price . they are warm and form fitting . they are thick and the design is nice . i plan on wearing them all winter !"
0 "i ordered the blue dress because i loved the color and unique design . the blue was much more of a dark navy not a sapphire blue as it looks in the picture . the picture also shows it tying on the side . it did not tie on the side when i tried it on but in the front as pictured in the red version of the dress . it was not at all flattering on me . one of the few disappointing things i have ordered from retailer ."
-1 "this top is too short so much so that tucking it in would be difficult . the designs are lovely but the short length is putting this top back on the rack ."
0 "tried this on in the onsie area of retailer store . i usually am between a medium and a large . the medium fit fine . the material in this top is substantial - very thick and soft but it is very thick as a warning . more for a pretty cool spring evening vs the heat of the summer in chicago . not sure how much the material would stretch out either . as it seems like it could be the type . also it is dry clean only and on such a casual top that is a real deal killer for me . regarding the style of"
-1 "very poorly made- wide and short very unflattering . the material is advertised as cotton but it felt very synthetic ."
0 "these are so cute and the colors are great however they stretch out about 2 sizes . they fit me perfectly and i sized down and they stretched out about a size 1/2 to 2 sizes too big . i 'm bummed out because they are perfect in every other way . did n't think they would stretch out as much as they did . and they look awful once they 've stretched out . wish i did n't take the tags off or i would have returned them . size down at least one size i could have sized down two sizes . hoping they shrink lik"
0 "at first i was interested . i liked the color the soft tencel fabric the cut in the back . it was all good . they did n't have my size in the store so i had to order it . when it arrived in the mail it was folded up and wrinkled . i tried it on and it looked like a lifeless unstructured blazer . i sent it back . all in all it is cute and fun for warm weather . it is definitely a casual blazer . i 'd probably wait for a sale on this one . it does run tts ."
1 "love this tank ! prettier shade of yellow in person . love the strap width and length . wish they 'd bring back more in lots of colors . i sized up one from my usual size and will have to shorten the length of the strap myself but it 's an easy alteration and is totally worth it ! especially good at sale price . i really hope they make more in the style in lots of colors . great find !"
-1 "i wanted to love this . however the fit was funky and the colors were muted . this is definitely something you must try on in the store . too risky to buy online due to weird fit ."
1 "i loved the idea of these pants as i 've been looking for an updated pair of tuxedo pants . i wear 26 in most of my jeans . i 'm not super skinny & consider my legs medium ( not too skinny & not too athletic ) . i tried these on in xs ( 36 european as marked on them ) & they were big around the waist & hip area . there was so much gap in the back which made them look frumpy ! i did however liked the length . the fabric is nice & heavy which i also loved . sadly these did n't work for me though . really wish t"
0 "i 'm normally a 10/12 and ordered the m/l . the body was a little big but ok. the arms are really wide . there are snaps to make them tighter but it does n't do much . i do like the embroidery . it 's an ok jacket but the fit could have been better ."
0 "fabulous fabric adorable details . fitting is very very odd . it 's non-adjustable in any way . the fabric has no stretch at all around the middle and the underwire of the bra is very stiff which i found painful . the straps were kind of loose but there is no way to tighten them because of the frills . when i bent over the shorts exposed the bottom of my butt . i 'd get a larger size but then i ca n't adjust the straps and they would definitely be too long and leave my breasts very exposed . overall"
-1 "i tried on an xs and it was boxy/roomy in the torso and the pocket on the wrist/forearm area made my arm look too bulky when i rolled the sleeves up like the model pictured . i love the idea of a relaxed fit cropped leather jacket in a versatile taupe color but when i tried this one on in person it took me back to my childhood . i used to help my dad wash his cars when i was a kid and he used a leather chamois ( shammy for short ) that was awesome for soaking up water . and that 's what it felt lik"
1 "really comfortable leggings ! not see through and at a great price !"
-1 "i followed the other reviews and sized down . normally i 'm a small/medium in retailer ( 5 ' 8/135 for clarification ) and i expected the garment to be a bit roomy . i ordered the small and when it arrived i almost called the corporate office to ensure i did n't have to pay rent on the romper given that you could comfortably fit a small family of five in it . oddly the arm-holes were normal sized ? i returned this mess ."
1 "this is a true tiny top ........ gorgeous and runs small . i usually wear a small or medium in retailer tops but timy i always size up . i 'm a 36c and a large fits perfect . the front is a bit sheer but not so much you need a cami ."
1 "i wanted to love this . the color in the picture is pretty true-to-life . the top fit well if a bit smaller than usual but the skirt piece was way too flared for my petite ( 5 ' ) frame . it was too voluminous compared to the top of the dress . the material is very soft but thin and is lined which was a pleasant surprise . sadly a return for me ."
-1 "i love the material on these shorts . unfortunately that 's all i love . the fit is awkward and i 'm an easy fit . they 're boxy in the body / legs and a bit tight in the waist causing me to not be sure whether to place the elastic waist higher or lower and neither one works well . sadly could n't keep these just for the pretty fabric ."
1 "i saw this romper online and knew i needed it as i love flannels and i love rompers . it 's super comfy . i bought with the intention of wearing it out not just around the house . i think in the fall it will be cute with high socks and boots but as i just got it i 've been opting for tights . lots of compliments so far . i got a small because i did n't want it to be too short it fits well ."
0 "has i read the reviews would have realized the t-shirt looking sleeves in the pic are attached to the sweater . based on the pic and site description i didnt realize they were attached . i thought it was part of the styling of the undershirt . i think this very much limits the versatility of the sweater . i ordered the white which is a beautiful color and very soft . i am returning it cause i do not like the t-shirt sleeve . would rather have the flexibility to layer whatever shirt i wanted"
1 "this is great lightweight top layer that 's just right for the little evening chill in the summer when the sun goes down or on a breezy day . it 's sheer so it requires a bottom layer . the medium fits a little tighter across the shoulders and arms for me than it shows on the model which i like ."
1 "i have been having the worst trouble lately finding cute comfortable cotton undies ... until i found these . these fit like a charm are incredibly soft and do n't ride up at all . ( sizing in spot on . ) plus they have the adorable lace trim that makes one feel nice and girly . last summer there was a nyt article saying that comforable underwear was coming back in style -- yay ! !"
-1 "ordered the biggest size available the large . the arms are so tight i could n't get it on . looked like it may have fit in the body so i do n't understand why so constricting in the arms . i do n't have big arms either . fabric is thin but the color is pretty . ca n't recommend . i 'd pass on this one ."
0 "i had a few pairs of these high-waisted beauties last year and love them so i was thrilled to see them in this adorable pattern which is even cuter in person . unfortunately the cut is different . the sides covered here by the model 's hands flare out a bit which is the function of the sectioning that the piping accentuates . the top is not the definitively high-wasted height from last year . i do n't own anything else high-wasted being an apple i 'm generally a low-rider owing to a small hips/butt"
-1 "this sweater was so itchy i immediately was turned off . it looks cute in pictures but another problem was that the knitting in the shoulders looks like a kid made it . it was uneven and stretched out . it looked like it was not well made to me . it also shed so much that just from me trying it on my pants were covered in orange fuzz . i returned this one ."
1 "i never write reviews but this dress is so fantastic i felt compelled to write one . it has unbelievably gorgeous detailing from delicate beading and sequins on the bodice to the three layers of the skirt : slip floral pattern pleats . i literally feel like a princess/ greek muse in this dress . ca n't recommend it enough . true to size ; i 'm 5 ' 7 and 133 lb and got a size 4 ."
-1 "it was so cute in the pictures and i was looking for something to wear to my trip to europe so i purchased it but it really did n't live up to my expectations . i 'm 5 ' 3 115 and got a s. it looked odd on me ... a little too short on the bottom a bit too big on top and overall i thought the material looked cheap for the price . i returned it ."
1 "i love this kimono ! the material and construction are beautiful but the one size fits all may be too big for a petite frame . you can throw it over the simplest outfit and make an instant glamour statement !"
-1 "i would n't be so unhappy if these pants cost about 75 % less . they are so cheaply constructed . one wash and they 're all but guaranteed to shrink . the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer . they are also 32 inch inseam not 35.5 as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them ."
-1 "recently received this and was very disappointed with the quality . the fabric was very thin easily stretched out of shape . price is ridiculous for this item !"
1 "the fabric is beautiful . did n't wrinkle so much after 8 hours in a suitcase . as opposed to the other reviewer mine arrived neatly stripes match nicely . i am kind of thick waisted and the size 6 was still perfect for me - i am currently 130 lbs 34-28-35. love the colors and the fabric a nice cotton twill lined pockets pretty bow belt . i am not a fan of the size zipper style but it is not a deal breaker . glad i have them ! !"
1 "this tunic is a wonderfully updated look . it 's cinched just a tad at the waist which gives it a great line . i paired it with a pair of citizens of humanity crop jeans . terrific look ! !"
0 "very pretty romantic"
0 "fit and style very nice . returned because way too long and bottom detail interfered with hemming . they were at least 4 too long . i am 5 ' 8 so heels would fix the issue but i do n't want to wear them with a comfy pair of pants ."
0 "i own the essential slims and love them so i figured i could order these in my normal size and they 'd fit great . i was way off . they were uncomfortably tight in the calves ( which is understandable - i 'm a runner so my calves are disproportionately large ) and uncomfortable in the waist . i decided to order one size bigger and pretty much had the same problem in the calves . the high waist was also still unflattering and uncomfortable . these might be great for hour glass shape with skinny calves . t"
0 "i really wanted this skirt to work but it did n't look very flattering on me . a great midi length and very cool pattern so hopefully will work for others !"
0 "i had high hopes for this coat but it was a miss for me . while the wool is soft and not itchy the colors are a lot duller in person and the embroidery looks messy . also the fit runs large with an unflattering poof in the back where the pleat is located . i thought about keeping it since i liked how soft the wool was but alas i just could not get over the poor tailoring . for reference i am usually a pxxs ( 5ft2in 105 lbs ) and it was big ."
